The automated installer here has been tested for Mageia 3 and Mageia 4,
with more work going into Mageia 4.

It is currently capable of installing Mageia 4 from Mageia-4-RC-x86_64-DVD.iso,
with the following variations:

KDE, Gnome or no desktop
LVM or non-LVM based partitioning.


At the time of writing, the is a bug in the installer that sometimes will
cause the installer to mis-align, in which case the test will fail, as it
can't match what it expects to find. 

Currently it relies or recogonising certian parts of the install screen,
using md5sum's.  This is unreliable, but needed because things in the installer
change depending on factors like disk size, and the automated installer
needs to push the right buttons.

The final output will always have the word fail in it.  To check, look at the video,
and see if serail0 file ends up with "010_consoletest_setup OK" in it.

If your computer is powerful enough, you can run muliple install tests at the 
same time.  


To get stated with testing Mageia4, do the following:
  git clone git://github.com/nelg/os-autoinst.git
  mkdir -p ~/tmp/test{1..2}
  cp os-autoinst/doc/env.sh-mageia4-sample1 ~/tmp/test1/env.sh 
  cp os-autoinst/doc/env.sh-mageia4-sample2 ~/tmp/test2/env.sh 
  ln Mageia-4-RC-x86_64-DVD.iso ~/tmp/test1/
  ln Mageia-4-RC-x86_64-DVD.iso ~/tmp/test2/

Window 1
  cd ~/tmp/test1/
  ../os-autoinst/tools/isotovideo Mageia-4-RC-x86_64-DVD.iso

Window 2
  cd ~/tmp/test1/
  ../os-autoinst/tools/isotovideo Mageia-4-RC-x86_64-DVD.iso
